#Why Skills Are Marked as Missing, even if they are in resume
a false positive was came like even the skills are there in resume, agent gave some of them as missing skilsls
🔍 Problem Summary
You're using sentence embeddings to compare each job skill to chunks (sentences) from the resume. If the maximum cosine similarity of a skill to any sentence in the resume is below 0.55, the skill is marked as missing.

This means:

Even if a skill exists in the resume, it could be marked missing if it's not phrased similarly or semantically matching the skill keyword.

👇 Why Skills Like “Python” or “SQL” Are Falsely Marked Missing
Here’s how that happens:

Your resume contains the skill in a list format under “Technical Skills” (e.g., Languages/Tools: C, C++, Python...)

When the resume is tokenized into sentences, that entire list might be just one sentence or may not be semantically rich enough.

The embedding for "Python" is compared to each sentence chunk. If the max similarity to any chunk is < 0.55 → it's labeled missing.

But since "Python" may not appear in a full contextual sentence (like "I developed data pipelines using Python"), the embedding similarity is low.
✅ How to Fix It
Here are 3 improvement options, in increasing order of reliability:

1. Add a fallback for exact keyword matching
If an exact skill (case-insensitive) appears in the resume text, don't flag it as missing — even if embedding score is low.

Add before the similarity check:

python
Copy
Edit
resume_text_lower = resume.lower()

for i, skill_emb in enumerate(skill_embeddings):
    skill_name = normalized_job_skills[i]
    if skill_name in resume_text_lower:
        continue  # Skill is present in raw text
    sim_scores = util.cos_sim(skill_emb, emb_chunks)
    if torch.max(sim_scores).item() < 0.55:
        missing_skills.append(job_skills[i])
2. Improve sentence chunking
Right now you’re using simple_sent_tokenize() which splits by . , ? , etc. That may treat the entire "Technical Skills" block as one sentence.

Try adding a step to split bullets, colons, and commas as well:

python
Copy
Edit
def enhanced_chunking(text: str) -> List[str]:
    chunks = re.split(r'[•\n,;:.]', text)
    return [chunk.strip() for chunk in chunks if chunk.strip()]
Use this instead of simple_sent_tokenize() when generating resume_chunks.

3. Boost chunk quality with section-aware extraction (Advanced)
If your resumes follow a LaTeX or Markdown-like structure (like your screenshot), you could use regex or simple parsers to specifically extract and label technical skill sections, e.g.:

python
Copy
Edit
def extract_technical_skills(resume: str) -> List[str]:
    match = re.search(r"Technical Skills.*?(?=\n[A-Z])", resume, re.DOTALL)
    if match:
        return re.split(r"[:,\n]", match.group())
    return []
Then append these skill lines to resume_chunks to ensure better semantic coverage.
